## What is Cirrus?

Cirrus is like a self-hosted Google Drive. It's a personal file host that you can use to securely access and store your files as you need them.

## Getting Started

To begin using Cirrus, you'll need:

- A server (AWS works fine, but your own server works best)
- Static IP or Dynamic DNS Service
- Docker
- NodeJS and Typescript*
- Firewall configured

### Server
For your server, you could theorically use any old desktop. For this guide, I'll assume your using Ubuntu, but other operating systems could also work. As long as it has networking capabilities and decent hardware, it should work fine.

### Static IP or Dynamic DNS Service
If you are already in good relations with your ISP, it would be best to reach out for a static IP address for your server. But that could come with extra costs that we are trying to avoid. Instead, you can keep your dynamic, public server IP and use a DDNS service (with a domain name if you have one) to update and point to your Server. 
</br>
</br>
**Note:** it is techincally possible to use Cirrus without either of these options. You would just have to set up a way to always know the IP from any other device. If you do plan on using Cirrus for personal use, I recommend doing this last, and to make sure it is working, before you contact your ISP or configure DDNS


### Firewall Configuration
To get public access to your server through the internet, you'll need configure the firewall on your server. Specfically, you need to open a few ports to allow traffics from other devices. We'll do this with UFW.

1. Install UFW: `sudo apt-get install ufw`
2. Enable UFW: `sudo ufw enable`
3. Allow HTTP and HTTPS: `sudo ufw allow 80/tcp` and `sudo ufw allow 443/tcp`
4. Check status: `sudo ufw status`

When your check the status, it should show the ports we need as open. A full map of the ports Cirrus uses can be found [Here](https://github.com/ReeseHatfield/Cirrus/blob/main/docs/Usage.md#port-mapping-table)


### Docker

Install Docker to run server containers. <br>[Full installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

### Running the server
Clone the repo and set up the server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ReeseHatfield/Cirrus.git
cd Cirrus
chmod +x cirrus.sh
./cirrus.sh
```

When you begin, the default username and password are `Admin` and `admin` To fix this and to add other users, we can go into the /admin directory. Run `sudo admin.sh` inside the admin folder. From here, you can add your own custom users and remove `Admin`. Cirrus will detect any background changes and now have a new user added
</br>
</br>
Note: In the current version, you need Node and Typescript installed locally for this to work. In a future version, I hope to have this run in a docker container to "eliminate" these dependencies. I ran into trouble getting stdin with node while inside a container. If someone wants to make a PR with this fix, feel free, contributions are always welcome. 

## Visiting the server
To test if the server is running, you can navigate to `localhost:5173`. To access your Cirrus from another device, you'll need the server's public IP address. This can be obtained using `curl api.ipify.org`. (A server port map can be viewed [here](https://github.com/ReeseHatfield/Cirrus/blob/main/docs/Usage.md#port-mapping-table)) Visit this IP in any web browser to access the Cirrus UI.

Through the UI, you can upload and download files from your server, all facilitated by a user-friendly web-based GUI, eliminating the need for SSH or other third-party software.
